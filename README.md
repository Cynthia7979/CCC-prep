## File Formats
For test cases, you'll have to download necessary zips from `Past Tests` above.
They are located on the page for each year's CCC problem sets. When you unzip them, remember to *only* keep the `all_data`
folder. 

`tester.py` is designed for 2020-2019 test cases. For former contests, adjust the file structure so it resembles:

```
| all_data/
    | j1/
    | j2/
    | ...
    | s1/
    | s2/
    | ...
```

or:

```
| all_data/
    | junior_data/
        | j1/
        | j2/
        | j3_s1/
        | ...
    | senior_data/
        | s1/
        | s2/
        | ...
```

Code files must be named according to the folder of the problem.

## Updates

Well, though I'm losing another piece of confidence on my problem solving skills...

... the grader (tester) I wrote is running incredibly smooth!

Can I submit this with my application if I did terrible on the competition? :joy:
